# Auzix Graphical Path

## Direction

The first native graphical target should be Enlightenment, not COSMIC.

COSMIC is compelling for a workstation-class Auzix personality, but it pulls a
larger modern desktop stack and should come after the boot, package, service,
and graphics substrate are stable. Enlightenment is a better first graphical
checkpoint because it is dramatic, historically aligned with lightweight
desktop experimentation, and built around EFL rather than a full GNOME/KDE
style stack.

The official Enlightenment project describes it as a window manager, compositor,
and minimal desktop for Linux/BSD-style systems. Its current release stream also
keeps EFL and Enlightenment as source-buildable components, which fits the
Auzix path-migration experiment.

## First GUI Stack

Target stack:

```text
/Stacks/graphical-enlightenment
```

Initial package order:

```text
EFL
Enlightenment
terminology or a smaller terminal fallback
light display manager or direct launch script
mesa/drm/input libraries as needed
```

Current upstream release targets checked on May 24, 2026:

```text
EFL 1.28.1
Enlightenment 0.27.1
Terminology 1.14.0
```

Native path intent:

```text
/Programs/EFL/<version>
/Programs/Enlightenment/<version>
/Programs/Terminology/<version>
/Services/display-manager
/Services/seat
/System/Settings/display
/System/State/display
/System/Logs/display
/Work/Builds/graphical
```

## Debian Control Baselines

VMID 132 is the current known-good graphical control system.

On May 25, 2026, a minimal Debian 13 install at `192.168.1.50` built and
installed from source:

```text
EFL 1.28.99
Enlightenment 0.27.99
```

Both were installed with Meson/Ninja into Debian's default `/usr/local` prefix.
The captured build logs and Meson introspection files are under:

```text
out/debian-control/efl
out/debian-control/enlightenment
```

Important baseline findings:

- EFL and Enlightenment build cleanly from source on a small Debian base once
  the development dependency set is present.
- The default EFL build selected the X11 engines and installed `ecore-x`,
  `software_x11`, and `gl_x11`.
- The default EFL build did not enable the Wayland/DRM compositor path:
  `ecore_wl2`, `ecore_drm2`, and related Wayland canvas pieces were disabled.
- EFL built `elput` with `evdev`, `logind`, and root fallback support, which
  means Auzix should either provide a normal enough seat/session/device
  contract or deliberately configure a different input path.
- Enlightenment built with `elput`, `ecore-x`, PAM, PulseAudio mixer support,
  udev device backend, NetworkManager/ConnMan modules, and its first-run wizard
  modules. ALSA was not detected in the control build.

That makes the present Auzix failure more likely to be a runtime contract issue
than a mystery in Enlightenment itself: device discovery, input permissions,
`/run`/`/var` state, user home ownership, DBus/session behavior, and the chosen
display backend need to match what EFL/Enlightenment actually built.

On May 26, 2026, the source install was removed and Debian's distribution
packages were installed instead:

```text
enlightenment 0.27.1-1
EFL libraries 1.28.1-1
```

The package-install logs, uninstall logs, dependency list, installed package
list, `ldd` output, and backend path inventory are under:

```text
out/debian-control/packages
```

The distribution package baseline is more useful for Auzix's first GUI package
shape than the plain source build:

- It installs both X11 and Wayland session files.
- The Wayland session runs `env E_WL_FORCE=drm E_COMP_ENGINE=gl
  /usr/bin/enlightenment_start`.
- `/usr/bin/enlightenment` links directly against `libecore_wl2`,
  `libefl_canvas_wl`, `libecore_drm2`, `libecore_x`, `libelput`, `libudev`,
  `libinput`, `libsystemd`, and `libdbus-1`.
- The EFL backend modules include `ecore_evas` engines for `drm`, `fb`,
  `wayland`, and `x`, plus Evas engines for `drm`, `gl_drm`, `wayland_egl`,
  `wayland_shm`, `gl_x11`, and `software_x11`.
- Installing just `enlightenment` on Debian pulled in 111 packages, including
  udisks2, PackageKit, xdg-desktop-portal, fprintd, BlueZ, GStreamer plugins,
  PipeWire libraries, filesystem helpers, and the EFL backend split packages.

For Auzix, this argues for staging the distro-package dependency shape first,
then trimming once the session is stable. The minimum useful graphical contract
is not only EFL plus the `enlightenment` binary; it also includes seat/input,
udev, DBus, systemd/logind-compatible behavior, Mesa/DRM/Wayland modules,
session files, helper binaries, and writable runtime state.

## First Boot Style

Do not make graphical boot the default immediately. The first GUI stage should
remain operator-controlled:

```sh
/System/Tools/start-e
```

That lets the shell-first ISO stay useful while we collect graphics, input,
seat, font, and library requirements. During VM bring-up, X11 is the default
operator path because Debian's packaged Wayland session can hang while the
DRM/seat contract is still incomplete.

`start-e` supports an explicit mode selector:

```sh
AUZIX_E_MODE=x11 /System/Tools/start-e
AUZIX_E_MODE=wayland /System/Tools/start-e
```

X11 is the default for the current VM and installer path. Debian's packaged
Enlightenment Wayland session is still useful as a later experiment, but it is
not stable enough to be the live or installed default.

The current live helper defaults to X11. `AUZIX_E_MODE=auto` is also treated as
X11-only for now. Use explicit `AUZIX_E_MODE=wayland` only when testing the
DRM/Wayland path.

## Start Sequence

The strict installed root uses:

```text
/init
/System/Boot/StartSequence
```

This is intentionally closer to an Amiga-style startup sequence than a full
systemd adoption. The current sequence mounts runtime filesystems, starts
BusyBox DHCP, and runs executable `/Services/*/run` hooks. It keeps Auzix
single-user friendly while giving us a place to attach `seatd`, SSH, and later
a display-manager service.

Installed roots should not rely on this boot sequence to repair every persistent
permission problem. `auzix-install-disk` now runs
`/System/Tools/finalize-installed-root /Work/InstallTarget` after copying the
live root, and package extraction runs the same finalizer against `/` when it is
available. The finalizer owns persistent user-state and helper-mode invariants:
`/Users/auzix/.cache`, `.config`, `.local`, `.midori`, Enlightenment state,
`/Work/Temp`, `/dev/shm`, `/run/user/1000`, sudo, Xorg.wrap, and Enlightenment
privileged helpers.

## Asset Staging

Local Enlightenment backgrounds, themes, and selected config can be staged into
the strict root with:

```sh
make auzix-strict-e-assets
```

The files land under:

```text
/Programs/DesktopAssets/auzietek/Resources/display/assets
```

The package exports per-file links into E's inherited global catalogs:

```text
/System/Compatibility/usr/share/enlightenment/themes
/System/Compatibility/usr/share/enlightenment/data/backgrounds
```

Theme selection and desktop configuration remain per-user. The ISO builder
does not duplicate packaged assets under `live/assets`.

## COSMIC Later

COSMIC remains a good later target for a polished workstation edition:

```text
/Stacks/graphical-cosmic
```

It should follow after:

- apk/Auzix package wrapping is working
- OpenSSH access is boring
- containerd/BuildKit can build or import packages
- disk persistence is proven
- one smaller graphical stack has already mapped the display/input requirements
